# Classifier

Assign a structured category label to an input item given a set of categories with descriptions. Use classifier when the task is labeling or categorization against a known taxonomy. Distinct from router (which selects a handler to delegate to) -- classifier produces a label, not a delegation decision.

## Contract

requires:
- item: the thing to classify
- categories: the category set, each with a description of what belongs in it
- rules: (optional) disambiguation rules for edge cases where categories overlap

ensures:
- classification: a structured result containing:
    - category: the selected category name
    - confidence: a score from 0 to 1 where 0.5 means genuine uncertainty, not "probably"
    - reasoning: which features of the item matched which category description
- if the item fits multiple categories: the best fit is returned with reasoning about why alternatives were rejected
- if the item fits no category: category is "uncategorized" with reasoning explaining why no category matched

errors:
- empty-categories: the category set is empty or contains no usable descriptions
- ambiguous-item: the item contains insufficient information to distinguish between two or more categories even after applying disambiguation rules

strategies:
- when categories overlap: apply disambiguation rules first; if none exist, prefer the more specific category over the general one
- when confidence is low: say so in the score rather than inflating confidence to avoid appearing uncertain
- when the item is complex: decompose it into features and match each feature against category descriptions independently before synthesizing a verdict

## Notes

Classifier is a pure labeling function. It does not know what the classification will be used for. It does not route, delegate, or act on the result. For selecting a handler to delegate work to, use router. For evaluating quality, use critic. For checking formal correctness, use verifier.
