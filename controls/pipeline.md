# Pipeline

Sequential transformation through multiple stages. Each stage sees only its predecessor's output.

## Shape

```
shape:
  self: [pass output of each stage as input to the next, no curation between stages]
  delegates:
    stage_1..stage_N: [transform input to output]
  prohibited: none
```

## Contract

```
requires:
  - &controlState exists at __controlState with:
      stages: string[]       -- ordered list of component names
      task_brief: string     -- initial input (goes to stage 1)

ensures:
  - Stage 1 receives the task brief as its input
  - Stage N receives stage N-1's output as its input — not the original brief
  - The pipeline does NOT curate between stages — it is a pure pass-through
  - If curation is needed: insert a role (e.g., summarizer) as an explicit stage
  - Each stage operates on a clean interface — no accumulated context
  - &controlState.result contains the final stage's output
  - &controlState.stage_outputs contains each stage's output
```

## Delegation

```javascript
const { stages, task_brief } = __controlState;
const stageOutputs = [];
let currentInput = task_brief;

for (let i = 0; i < stages.length; i++) {
  const output = await rlm(currentInput, null, { use: stages[i] });
  stageOutputs.push(output);
  currentInput = String(output);
}

__controlState.result = currentInput;
__controlState.stage_outputs = stageOutputs;
return(currentInput);
```

## Notes

No stage knows it is part of a pipeline. Each receives input and produces output. The isolation between stages is the structural guarantee — each stage operates on a clean interface defined solely by its predecessor's output. If stage 3 needs information from stage 1, insert an intermediate stage that carries it forward, or restructure the pipeline.
