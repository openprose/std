## Contract

requires:
- template: path to an HTML template with placeholder markers
- data: structured output from programs
- output_path: where to write the rendered HTML
- strict: (optional, default false) boolean — if true, error on missing data fields; if false, use "data pending" markers for missing fields

ensures:
- rendered: confirmation the file was written successfully
- html_path: the output file path
- all template placeholders are resolved to data values, or marked "data pending" in non-strict mode

errors:
- template-not-found: the template path does not exist or is not readable
- data-incomplete: (strict mode only) one or more template placeholders have no corresponding data field

invariants:
- template structure, styling, and layout are preserved exactly — only placeholder markers are replaced
- output HTML is valid if the input template was valid

strategies:
- when rendering: replace all placeholder markers in the template with corresponding values from the data. Preserve the template's structure, styling, and layout.
- when strict is true and a data field is missing: signal data-incomplete error listing all unresolved placeholders
- when strict is false and a data field is missing: insert a visible "data pending" marker in place of the missing value
