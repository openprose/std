## Contract

requires:
- content: structured output to deliver
- channel: Slack channel name
- format: (optional, default "summary+attachment") one of "summary+attachment", "full", "alert"

ensures:
- delivered: confirmation with timestamp and permalink
- attachment_url: link to the uploaded file — present only when format is "summary+attachment"

errors:
- webhook-failed: the Slack webhook returned a non-2xx status or was unreachable
- channel-not-found: the specified channel does not exist or the bot lacks permission to post there

environment:
- SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: webhook for posting messages
- SLACK_BOT_TOKEN: (required for "summary+attachment" format which uploads files via the Slack API; optional for "full" and "alert" which use webhook only)

strategies:
- when format is "summary+attachment": post a concise summary in the message body and attach the full content as a file (requires SLACK_BOT_TOKEN for file upload)
- when format is "full": post the entire content inline via webhook
- when format is "alert": post a short notification with a link to the full content via webhook
