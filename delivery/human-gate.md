name: human-gate
kind: service
shape:
  self: [present output for human review, block until approved or rejected]
  delegates: []
  prohibited: [modifying the content, approving on behalf of the human, proceeding without explicit approval when gate_level requires it]

## Contract

requires:
- content: the output to review
- gate_level: one of "all", "external", "none"
- review_channel: where to present the review request — e.g. Slack channel ID or email address

ensures:
- approved: boolean — true if the reviewer approved, or if gate_level is "none" (auto-approved without review)
- feedback: (optional) structured edits from the reviewer, suitable for `apply(content, feedback)` — present only when the reviewer provides modifications
- if gate_level is "none": approved is true immediately with no human review and no feedback

errors:
- reviewer-timeout: the reviewer did not respond within the configured review window
- channel-unreachable: the review channel could not be contacted (invalid channel, permissions issue, or service unavailable)

invariants:
- content substance is preserved unless feedback explicitly modifies it
- when gate_level is "all" or "external", a human must have explicitly approved before approved is true

strategies:
- when gate_level is "all": post every output for review, block until the reviewer responds
- when gate_level is "external": only review content that will be sent outside the org (outreach emails, reports to customers)
- when gate_level is "none": skip review entirely — return approved: true with no feedback
