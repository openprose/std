name: file-writer
kind: service
shape:
  self: [write content to a file at a local, S3, or GCS destination]
  delegates: []
  prohibited: [modifying the content substance — you serialize and write, you do not edit]

## Contract

requires:
- content: structured output to write
- destination: file path or URI — local path, s3:// URI, or gs:// URI
- format: (optional, default "md") output format — one of "md", "json", "csv", "html"

ensures:
- written_path: the resolved path or URI where the file was written
- bytes_written: the size of the written file in bytes

errors:
- write-failed: the write operation failed (disk full, network error, service unavailable)
- path-not-found: the parent directory or bucket does not exist
- permission-denied: insufficient permissions to write to the destination

environment:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: (optional) required for S3 destinations
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: (optional) required for S3 destinations
- GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: (optional) required for GCS destinations

invariants:
- content is serialized faithfully in the requested format — no fields added, removed, or transformed beyond format encoding
- if the destination already exists, it is overwritten (not appended)

strategies:
- when format is "json": serialize the content as formatted JSON
- when format is "csv": serialize the content as CSV with headers derived from the data structure
- when format is "html": write the content as an HTML document
- when format is "md": write the content as Markdown
- when destination is an S3 URI: use AWS SDK or CLI to upload
- when destination is a GCS URI: use Google Cloud SDK or CLI to upload
- when destination is a local path: write directly to the filesystem
