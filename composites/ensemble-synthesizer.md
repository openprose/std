# Ensemble-Synthesizer

K agents work independently on the same task. A synthesizer merges by reasoning about disagreements.

## Shape

```
shape:
  self: [fan out to K ensemble members, collect results, delegate to synthesizer]
  delegates:
    ensemble_member: [produce a result given the brief — run K times]
    synthesizer: [merge K results by reasoning about disagreements]
  prohibited: none
```

## Contract

```
requires:
  - &compositeState exists at __compositeState with:
      ensemble_member: string   -- component name for each ensemble member
      synthesizer: string       -- component name for the synthesizer
      task_brief: string        -- the task (same brief goes to all members)
      ensemble_size: number     -- (optional, default 3)

ensures:
  - All K members receive the SAME brief independently
  - Synthesizer receives all K results — its job is NOT majority voting
  - Synthesizer reasons about WHY results differ — disagreements are signal
    about ambiguity or difficulty
  - Returns the synthesized result plus a confidence assessment
  - &compositeState.result contains the synthesis
  - &compositeState.member_results contains the K individual results
```

## Delegation

```javascript
const { ensemble_member, synthesizer, task_brief, ensemble_size = 3 } = __compositeState;

// Fan out to K members — each works independently
const memberResults = [];
for (let i = 0; i < ensemble_size; i++) {
  const result = await rlm(task_brief, null, { use: ensemble_member });
  memberResults.push(result);
}

// Synthesizer merges
const synthBrief = `${ensemble_size} independent agents worked on the same task. Reason about their results — where they agree, where they disagree, and why.\n\nOriginal task: ${task_brief}\n\nResults:\n${memberResults.map((r, i) => `--- Agent ${i + 1} ---\n${r}`).join("\n\n")}`;
const synthesis = await rlm(synthBrief, null, { use: synthesizer });

__compositeState.result = synthesis;
__compositeState.member_results = memberResults;
return(synthesis);
```

## Notes

This is a seed pattern. Ensemble members do not know other agents are working on the same task. The synthesizer does not know it is part of an ensemble composite. Disagreement between members is the primary signal — it reveals ambiguity in the task, not errors in individual agents.
